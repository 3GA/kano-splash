This directory builds kano-splash and kano-get-start-time

The former is derived from pngview in https://github.com/AndrewFromMelbourne/raspidmx
which uses low-level rpi gpu apis.

kano-splash can be added as a command line interpreter to launch a splash screen.
Eg, change

#!/usr/bin/env python 

to 

#!/usr/bin/kano-splash /usr/share/kano-foo/splash/png /usr/bin/env python 

The app mush then call 
system("kano-stop-splash") 

to stop the splash (or wait for it to time out at 15 seconds).
