# Sends a signal to a Kano app (save, load, share, make, launch-share)

# This script is invoked by the Kano Keyboard hotkeys (xbindkeys in Kano Desktop).
# If you call it from a shell or command line, make sure you export DISPLAY
# to point to your desktop.

# It is also invoked from Kano World when launching a Share.
# The chromium hooks connect to kano-profile.apps module,
# it calls this script with "launch-share <filename>,
# which will open a share on the currently running app.

# Exit code 0 means the signal could be delivered, any other value means error.
